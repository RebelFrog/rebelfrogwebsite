# Rebel Frog Modernization Ecosystem: Concept & Strategy

## 1. Core Vision
To pivot the brand from a CRM utility to a "Modernization Architect" firm. The platform must showcase 30 years of technical leadership, $200M in revenue scaling, and 15 patents.

## 2. Target Audience
SMBs ($5M - $50M revenue) struggling with fragmented data silos, inefficient processes, and a lack of actionable business intelligence.

## 3. Core Service Pillars
*   **Business Analysis & ROI Modeling:** Auditing profitability and identifying "Invisible Profit" via margin gain.
*   **Data Discovery & Integration:** Dismantling data silos (ERP, Finance, CRM) to find the "Single Source of Truth."
*   **Agentic Workflow Design:** Building automated systems that reason (Trigger -> Process -> Decide -> Act).
*   **Fractional CTO/COO Advisory:** Corporate governance coaching and technical strategy.

## 4. Key Functional Requirements
*   **Executive Command Center:** Embedded Looker Studio dashboards for real-time client BI.
*   **The Innovation Vault:** A visual portfolio of 15 patents and revenue scaling case studies.
*   **Discovery Portal:** An interactive tool for clients to self-assess process bottlenecks.
*   **Agentic Sales Engine:** Automated lead triage and call summarization via Workspace Studio.

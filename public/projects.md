# Our Projects

Here are some of the projects we're proud of.

## Project Spotlight: SeniorGuard AI & The Protection Ecosystem
The Problem: Financial exploitation of seniors is a $30+ billion-a-year "silent epidemic." Scammers are now using sophisticated AI-voice cloning and deepfakes to bypass traditional safety measures.

The Solution: A multi-layered AI SaaS (Software as a Service) platform designed to act as a "Digital Bodyguard" for the elderly and a "Safety Dashboard" for their families.

Core Technical Features:
Real-Time Sentiment & Fraud Analysis: An on-device tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze incoming texts, emails, and calls for "urgency markers" and known scam patterns common in financial elder abuse.

The "Vetting Engine": A real-time query tool where seniors can take a photo of a suspicious mailer or copy-paste a link to receive an immediate "Risk Score" based on a proprietary database of global scam tactics.

Educational Continuity: Unlike static webinars, our platform uses AI to deliver "Micro-Learning" modules—30-second daily tips tailored to the specific scams currently trending in the user's local zip code.

Family Sync Integration: An optional "Guardian Mode" that alerts designated family members if the user is engaging with a high-risk interaction, allowing for intervention before a financial transaction occurs.

Strategic Partnerships & Scalability:
We are currently in discussions with National Senior Protection Organizations to integrate this technology into their existing outreach programs. This "B2B2C" (Business to Business to Consumer) model allows for rapid scaling and instant trust-building within the senior community.

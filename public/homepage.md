## The Real Problem Isn't Your Product—It's Your Operations

- **Cash Flow Crisis:** Making over $1M in revenue but still operating at a loss? Hidden inefficiencies are bleeding your working capital.
- **Inventory Chaos:** Over-purchasing components that sit on shelves while capital is locked up. No visibility into what you have or what you need.
- **Manual Process Overload:** Your team spends hours on administrative tasks that should take minutes. Every day is firefighting instead of forward progress.
- **Data Blindness:** You're making critical decisions without real data. Spreadsheets are scattered. Systems don't connect.
- **Scaling Barriers:** You want to expand, but your current operations can barely handle what you have now.
- **Technology Fragmentation:** Too many disconnected tools. Nothing integrates. Your team wastes time switching between platforms.

These aren't just inconveniences—they're profit killers.

## Real Results: Manufacturing Turnaround

The Challenge: A Florida Manufacturer was on track to exceed $1M in revenus, but operating at a loss.

**What We Found:**
- No inventory control system—purchasing was based on gut feeling.
- Excess components tying up $300K+ in working capital.
- Antiquated manufacturing software creating bottlenecks.
- Zero visibility into vendor costs and component pricing trends.

**What We Did:**
- Implemented inventory tracking and automated reorder systems.
- Created data-driven purchasing workflows.
- Integrated manufacturing software with financial reporting.
- Built business intelligence dashboards for real-time visibility.

**The Result:** Within 90 days, the company freed up over **$180K in working capital**, reduced purchasing costs by **23%**, and gained the operational foundation needed to scale.

## Led by a Proven CEO, Not a Marketing Consultant

**Founder: Dean Mercier**
*Technology Transformation Leader | Two-Time Founder | Category Creator*

Most consultants have never built a company. Dean has built two—and scaled one from zero to **$200M+ in lifetime revenue**. He has secured 15 patents, won CES and Disney innovation awards, and led technology transformations for Fortune 500 companies.

> "I've been in your shoes. I know what it's like to manage cash flow, negotiate with vendors, and scale into new markets. That perspective—combined with deep technology expertise—is what makes our transformations successful."

## Business Consulting Meets AI Automation

We offer two interconnected services:
1.  **Business Transformation Consulting:** Executive-level operational analysis and turnaround strategy for companies facing inefficiency or cash flow issues.
2.  **AI-Powered Automation Implementation:** Smart technology solutions that eliminate manual chaos and create operational efficiency (CRM, workflow optimization, etc.).

Technology without strategy is expensive chaos. Strategy without implementation is just consulting theater. We deliver both.

# About Rebel Frog Studios

## Founded by a CEO Who Built Companies, Not Just Consulted About Them

Rebel Frog Studios exists because too many business consultants have never actually run a business. They understand theory. We understand reality.

Our founder, Dean Mercier, has spent 30+ years in the trenches—building companies from zero, scaling operations to $200M+, managing cash flow, negotiating with vendors, optimizing manufacturing, and leading teams through growth and transformation.

This isn't academic knowledge. It's battle-tested expertise from someone who has faced the same challenges you're facing now.

## Founder Story: Dean Mercier

**Two-Time Founder | Category Creator | Technology Transformation Leader**

### The Entrepreneurial Journey: GAEMS Inc. (2011-2021)

In 2011, Dean founded GAEMS Inc. with a vision: create the first truly portable gaming experience for console gamers. This wasn't an incremental improvement—it was inventing an entirely new product category.

**The Challenge:**
- Zero existing market or customer base
- Needed to educate retailers and consumers about a product that didn't exist
- Required hardware innovation, manufacturing expertise, supply chain development, and retail channel partnerships
- Bootstrapped with limited capital

**What Dean Built:**
- **Product Innovation:** Invented and patented portable gaming monitors with integrated storage, audio, and power systems.
- **Manufacturing Excellence:** Established relationships with Asian manufacturers, managed quality control, and optimized production costs.
- **Retail Distribution:** Built partnerships with Microsoft, Best Buy, Amazon, GameStop, and 100+ retailers globally.
- **Brand Recognition:** Won CES Best New Gaming Hardware Award and Disney Innovation Showcase recognition.
- **Team & Operations:** Grew from solo founder to 20+ person team managing R&D, operations, marketing, and sales.
- **Intellectual Property:** Secured 15 patents protecting innovations in hardware design and integration.

**The Numbers:**
- Scaled from $0 to $20M company valuation
- Generated $200M+ in lifetime revenue
- Established global distribution across 15+ countries
- Maintained profitability while reinvesting in R&D and growth

This experience taught Dean everything about running a real business—cash flow management during growth, inventory optimization, vendor negotiation, quality control, scaling operations, building teams, and making strategic decisions under pressure. These aren't theories. They're lived experiences.

### The Technology Transformation Career

While building GAEMS, Dean also maintained deep expertise in enterprise technology:

**Enterprise HCM & Business Intelligence (2009-2023):**
- Led enterprise implementations for Fortune 500 companies and government agencies
- Specialized in data integration, workflow automation, and business intelligence
- Served as SME consultant for State of Alaska statewide HCM modernization initiative
- Managed Kronos WFM implementations for major healthcare systems (40,000+ employees)
- Architected data migration strategies and integration mapping for complex enterprise platforms
- Most recently: Application Development Analyst at Hormel Foods, leading migration from legacy systems to UKG Pro SaaS (13+ integrations, 4,500+ hardware deployments)

This experience brings the ability to architect enterprise-level technology solutions and apply them to small-medium businesses. Dean understands both the operational challenges businesses face AND the technology solutions that can solve them.

### Why Small-Medium Businesses?

**Dean's Philosophy:**
> "After spending years in enterprise consulting and building my own company, I realized where I could have the biggest impact: small to medium-sized businesses that are ready to grow but stuck in operational chaos. These companies don't need another marketing consultant promising viral growth. They need someone who understands the fundamentals—cash flow, operations, vendor management, team building—and who can combine that knowledge with modern technology. I get excited helping a manufacturer free up $200K in trapped inventory. I love seeing a service business owner reclaim 30 hours a week through automation. That's where transformation really happens—and I get to watch these companies realize their potential."
